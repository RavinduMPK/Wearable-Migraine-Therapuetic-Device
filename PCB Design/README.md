# Designing and Fabricating PCB
The creation of our wearable migraine therapeutic device necessitated the development of a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) to accommodate connectors, buttons, microcontrollers, and ICs. This README provides insights into the process of designing, fabricating, and refining our PCB for optimal performance.

## PCB Design Process
To seamlessly integrate our components, we employed the industry-standard software Altium for both PCB schematic design and layout. This approach allowed us to visualize and engineer the intricate connections and layout of our device's internal components.

### Two-Layer PCB Layout
Considering the compact nature of our device, a two-layer PCB layout was chosen. This decision facilitated efficient component placement and effective routing within the confined space, enabling us to optimize the performance while adhering to the spatial constraints.

## Iterative Improvement
### Initial Prototype
For our initial prototype, we designed a simplified PCB and produced it locally. The local manufacturing process allowed us to swiftly iterate on the design while observing the prototype's performance and identifying areas for enhancement.

### Learning from Observations
By meticulously examining the prototype, we identified areas for improvement in terms of component placement, signal integrity, and overall layout. These observations were pivotal in refining our design for enhanced functionality and performance.

### Advanced Iteration
Building on the insights gained from our initial prototype, we iterated on the design to rectify observed errors and incorporate enhancements. Our refined design was meticulously crafted to address previous shortcomings and optimize the circuit layout for improved functionality.

## Collaboration with JLC PCB
To execute our advanced design, we partnered with JLC PCB in China for professional fabrication. This collaboration allowed us to harness their expertise in producing high-quality PCBs at scale, ensuring accuracy and precision in the manufacturing process.

## Results
The culmination of our efforts yielded a refined, professionally fabricated PCB that integrates connectors, buttons, microcontrollers, and ICs seamlessly. The iterative design process, coupled with collaboration with JLC PCB, resulted in a high-performance PCB tailored to our wearable migraine therapeutic device's unique requirements.
