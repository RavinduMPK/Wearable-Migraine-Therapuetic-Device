# Enclosure Design
The enclosure design for our wearable migraine therapeutic device was a cornerstone of our product's development. This README offers insights into our enclosure design process, our approach to size optimization, and the tools we utilized.

## SolidWorks Software
For the meticulous creation of our enclosure, we harnessed the capabilities of SolidWorks design software. This industry-standard tool empowered us to model and visualize the physical form of the device, ensuring a high degree of accuracy and precision.

## Size Optimization
One of our paramount considerations was the minimization of the enclosure's size. We undertook rigorous efforts to optimize the dimensions to comfortably fit on the forehead while housing all the necessary components. This size optimization was instrumental in ensuring the device's comfort and wearability.

## Three-Part Enclosure Design
To maintain an optimal balance between functionality and aesthetics, we divided the enclosure into three distinct parts. Each part was thoughtfully designed to fit seamlessly together, allowing for easy access to internal components while presenting a unified and ergonomic exterior.

## 3D Printing and Local Fabrication
With the design solidified, we translated our virtual models into physical reality through 3D printing. Leveraging locally available resources, we materialized our enclosure design into tangible components. This approach facilitated a hands-on experience and allowed us to evaluate the physical enclosure's form and fit.

## Results
The culmination of our enclosure design efforts resulted in a compact, functional, and aesthetically pleasing housing for our wearable migraine therapeutic device. The utilization of SolidWorks for design and local 3D printing for fabrication enabled us to bring our vision to life and ensure that our device harmoniously integrates technology with user comfort.
