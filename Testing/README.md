# Testing
Ensuring the precision and reliability of our circuit's operation was a pivotal aspect of our project's success. Rigorous testing procedures were carried out within a controlled laboratory environment to validate the functionality and accuracy of our circuit design.

## Oscilloscope Observations
To comprehensively assess the performance of our circuit, we employed an oscilloscope to visualize and analyze waveforms at each crucial sub-module. By directly observing the waveforms, we verified that the circuit was generating the required waveforms as per our design specifications. This meticulous observation allowed us to ensure the correct operation of the circuit and validate the functionality of each individual sub-module.

## Verified Final Output Waveform
Through the collective observations and analyses at each sub-module, we confidently observed and documented the final output waveform. This waveform serves as a tangible representation of the device's therapeutic signal generation. Its accuracy and consistency were critical in affirming that the circuit successfully met our intended objectives.

Our commitment to rigorous testing and waveform observation validated the precision of our circuit's operation, ensuring that it reliably generates the required waveforms to provide effective migraine relief.
