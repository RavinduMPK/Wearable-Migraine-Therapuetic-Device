# Circuit Design
In the creation of our wearable migraine therapeutic device, a meticulously designed circuit played a pivotal role. The circuit encompasses a series of interconnected modules that collectively generate the desired therapeutic output. This README provides an in-depth understanding of each module's function within the circuit design.

## Inputs
The core input of the device is facilitated through a push-button switch. We have chosen the 6Pin Two Row Through Hole Mount DPDT Self-Locking Mounting Tact Tactile Power Micro Push Button as the main switch. This input initiates the device's operation and serves as the catalyst for the subsequent modules.

## Signal Generation Unit
The Signal Generation Unit is a pivotal component, divided into several sub-modules to ensure precision and effectiveness.

### Micro-controller Unit: 
This module is responsible for generating a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signal with a dynamically varying duty cycle. Our micro-controller programming orchestrates a gradual increase in the duty cycle over a duration of 16 minutes, followed by a subsequent 4-minute decrease.

### Digital-Analog Converter: 
This sub-module facilitates the conversion of the PWM signal generated by the micro-controller into an analog stair-case signal. To achieve this, a second-order filter circuit is employed, tuned to filter out harmonics and retain the essential DC component of the signal.

### Sampling Signal Generator: 
To sample the stair-case signal from the above sub-module, a 555 timer IC-based signal generator is utilized. The need for a sampling signal around 100Hz necessitated this separate signal generator, as the micro-controller cannot generate such low-frequency PWM signals.

### Sampling Unit: 
This sub-module's primary role is to accurately sample the stair-case signal. It employs a BJT transistor in switching mode, with meticulously calculated base and collector resistor values to ensure the transistor operates within the switching region.

### Voltage-Current Converter: 
In the final phase of the circuit, the generated voltage signal is converted into a current signal. This sub-module employs an Op-Amp circuit functioning as a voltage-current converter. A key feature is its ability to deliver a current signal that remains independent of the output load, ensuring consistent therapeutic output.

## Outputs
The core output of our circuit is the therapeutic current, delivered through three electrode terminals. Furthermore, the device incorporates feedback outputs to enhance user-friendliness:

- A red LED indicates the device is in Power ON mode.
- A green LED indicates the device is in Operating mode.
- A buzzer emits a distinct beep sound at the commencement and conclusion of the Operating mode.

## Power Supply Unit
To sustain the device's operation, four coin cells serve as the primary power source. Additionally, a 7805 IC is utilized to regulate the supply voltage, ensuring consistent and reliable device functionality.

The comprehensive circuit design combines these modules to create a robust and functional wearable migraine therapeutic device. The interconnected modules work in harmony to generate the desired therapeutic effects, enhancing user experience and comfort.
